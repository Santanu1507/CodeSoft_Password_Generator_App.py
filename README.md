# Password Generator App

The Password Generator App is a simple graphical application built using the tkinter library in Python. It allows the user to generate a random password of a specified length and displays it along with the associated username. The app also provides options to accept or reject the generated password and generate a new one if needed.

## Features

- Generate a random password with customizable length
- Display the generated password along with the associated username
- Option to accept or reject the generated password
- Generate a new password if the user rejects the previous one
- User-friendly interface with input fields and buttons

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually included in the standard library)

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Run the script by executing the Python file.
3. The Password Generator App window will appear.
4. Enter the desired username and password length.
5. Click on the "Generate Password" button to generate a random password.
6. The generated password will be displayed along with the username.
7. You can either accept or reject the password using the corresponding buttons.
8. If you reject the password, a new password will be generated, and you can repeat the accept or reject process.

## Example

Suppose you want to generate a password for a user named "JohnDoe" with a password length of 12 characters. Follow these steps:

1. Enter "JohnDoe" in the "Enter User Name" field.
2. Enter "12" in the "Enter Password Length" field.
3. Click on the "Generate Password" button.
4. A random password will be displayed, such as "4zP$1a2T@J8b".
5. You can choose to accept or reject this password using the "Accept Password" or "Reject Password" buttons.
6. If you reject the password, a new password will be generated automatically.

## Customization

The Password Generator App is a basic implementation. You can customize and enhance the application based on your specific requirements. For instance:

- You can modify the appearance by changing the font, button colors, and layout.
- Add more complexity to the password generation algorithm (e.g., including/excluding specific characters).
- Implement additional password-related features such as password strength indicator, password saving, etc.
- Enhance the error handling to handle edge cases and invalid inputs.

Feel free to explore and adapt the code to suit your needs.
